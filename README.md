# An application on the Cesar algorithm with the ability to parse characters using the Python programming language

This project aims to train how to design cryptographic algorithms using the Python programming language, and at the same time, it seeks to teach how to create easy and simple user interfaces in Python.

I published an application on the Cesar algorithm earlier. The most important thing in this project is to add the character frequency analysis feature. In the past, they used this analysis in order to facilitate attempts to decrypt the algorithm by writing text and calculating the number of the most frequent letters and then guessing. Based on that.

By running the code or by opening the caesar.exe file located in the dist folder, you can see the user interface how it works in a simple way. You must first specify the encryption key, which is a number that expresses the amount of displacement, and then you can encrypt or decrypt the text. There is also a button that analyzes the frequency of characters.
